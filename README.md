Various features of this website are-
	Automaitc attendence using idcards of student (App work is not completed yet)

	Multiple schools can use the same website (on one server).
	A lot of attention have been paid on optimisation.
	Does not reduces freedom of teachers and allows them to work just as before without compromising with security.
